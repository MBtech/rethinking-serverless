# Input Data
This directory contains the input data used for different serverless applications

1. `images` contains data that is used for `faceblur` and `facedetect` applications
2. `ocr` contains images used for `ocr` application
3. `videos` contains videos used for `transcode` and `s3` applications

**Note**: For Linpack we simply use the input matrix size so there is no input data file for it

## Default data 
The research uses one input as a default (representative) for the analysis. 
Following are the default inputs for each type of data:

1. Images: `faces2.jpg`
2. OCR: `doc.png`
3. Videos: `cats-1.mp4`
